                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaniwar_Wada"><sub>  (wiki)</sub></a>
                <img src="../resources/images/Shaniwarwada.jpg" alt="image">
                <p>The Shaniwarwada was normally the seven-storey capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire.
                    It was supposed to be made entirely of stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first
                    storey, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Shahu(King) saying that a
                    stone
                    monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Shahu(King) himself and not the Peshwas. Even today
                    if you visit and see the walls carefully, they are partly made of
                    stone and partly by bricks. The Wada was then completed and upon being attacked by the British
                    Artillery
                    90 years later, all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone base, which was immune to
                    the
                    British artillery.
                </p>

                    By 1758, at least a thousand people lived in the fort.
                    In 1773, Narayanrao, who was the fifth and ruling Peshwa then, was murdered by guards on orders of
                    his uncle Raghunathrao and aunt Anandibai. A popular legend has it that Narayanrao's ghost still
                    calls for help on full moon nights. Various people, working around the area, have allegedly reported
                    the cries of "Kaka mala vachava"(Uncle, save me) by Narayanrao Peshwa after his death.
                    In June 1818, the Peshwa, Bajirao II, abdicated his Gaadi (throne) to Sir John Malcolm of the
                    British East India Company and went into political exile at Bithoor, near Kanpur in present-day
                    Uttar Pradesh, India.
                    On 27 February 1828, a great fire started inside the palace complex. The conflagration raged for
                    seven days. Only the heavy granite ramparts, strong teak gateways and deep foundations and ruins of
                    the buildings within the fort survived.

                <h3 style="display: inline;"><u><strong>Aga Khan Palace</strong></u></h3>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_Palace"><sub>  (wiki)</sub></a>
                <img src="../resources/images/aga khan.jpg" alt="image">
                <p>The Aga Khan Palace was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in Pune, India. The palace was an
                    act of charity by the spiritual leader of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims, who wanted to help the poor in
                    the neighbouring areas of Pune, who were drastically hit by famine.
                    The Aga Khan Palace is a majestic building. The palace is closely linked to the Indian freedom
                    movement as it served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi, his secretary
                    Mahadev Desai and Sarojini Naidu. It is also the place where Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai
                    died. In 2003, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) declared the site as a monument of national
                    importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, the palace holds great significance. Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi and his
                    secretary Mahadev Desai were interned in the palace from 9 August 1942 to 6 May 1944, following the
                    launch of Quit India Movement. Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadev Desai died during their captivity period
                    in the palace and have their Samadhis located over there. Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi have
                    their memorials located in the same complex, near Mula river. Legend goes that the Sultan built
                    the palace to provide employment to the famine – struck villagers of the surrounding region; so he
                    employed 1000 people, and the palace was constructed in five years. It was built in Rs 12 lakhs. The
                    total area is 13 acres and built up palace covers seven acres, and the rest is a well maintained
                    garden.
                    Today the palace houses a memorial on Gandhi where his ashes were
                    kept. The then prime minister Indira Gandhi had visited the place in 1974 where she allotted a sum
                    of ₹200,000 (US$2,800) every year, for its maintenance. The amount rose to ₹1 million (US$14,000)
                    till the 1990s, after which the national monument of India, was neglected for many years due to
                    improper allocation of funds.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati_Hill"><sub>  (wiki)</sub></a>
                <img src="../resources/images/Parvati.jpg" alt="image">
                <p>Parvati Hill is a hillock in Pune, India. The hillock rises to 2,100 feet (640 m) above sea level.
                    Atop the hillock is the Parvati Temple, one of the most scenic locations in Pune. The temple is the
                    oldest heritage structure in Pune and was built during the rule of the Peshwa dynasty. For
                    visitors, Parvati hill is also an observation point that offers a panoramic view of Pune. It is the
                    second highest point in Pune (after Vetal Hill). The hill has 103 steps leading to the top of the
                    hill where the temple is situated.The hill was owned by the Patil named Taware . Peshwa purchased
                    the hill from this patil to build a temple of shiv . The Devi temple was believed to be of Taware’s
                    kulswami who’s angara was able to cure kashibai, peshwa’s mother’s injuries. Since then Peshwa was
                    the regular visitor of this temple.
                    The main temple, Devdeveshwara, is made of blackstone. It was completed under Balaji Baji Rao, in
                    1749. Other temples are dedicated to Vitthal and Rukmini, Vishnu, and Kartikeya.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataleshwar"><sub>  (wiki)</sub> </a>
                <img src="../resources/images/Pataleshwar.jpg" alt="image">
                <p>The Pataleshwar Cave Temple (also called Panchaleshvara or Bamburde) is a rock-cut cave temple,
                    carved out in the 8th century in the Rashtrakuta period by Kannadiga kings. It is located in what
                    is now Pune, in the state of Maharashtra, India. It was originally situated outside the town, but
                    the city limits have expanded so that it is now located on the downtown Jangali Maharaj Road. It has
                    been declared as a protected monument by the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The temple, made of basalt rock, is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The sanctum - a cube-shaped
                    room about 3–4 metres on each side - houses a linga - the symbol of Shiva and there are two smaller
                    cells on each side. In front of the cave is a circular Nandi mandapa, its umbrella shaped canopy
                    supported by massive square pillars. This mandapa is one of the peculiar structures of Pataleshwar.
                    The cave is located at a lower level than the present level of the road and the cave complex. There
                    is an exquisitely carved circular Nandi shrine in the huge courtyard of the cave. The main cave is
                    rectangular on plan and has a pillared porch. There are three sanctums in the cave temple and the
                    central one houses the Shivalinga. There is a circumambulation path provided in the cave where one
                    can see the unfinished part of the cave temple. It appears that after finishing the front and the
                    sanctum the cave was left incomplete due to some reasons, one of which could be the faults in the
                    rock. However the walls in the main cave have some outlines drawn suggesting the sculptures
                    depicting stories from Indian mythology, especially involving Shiva.
